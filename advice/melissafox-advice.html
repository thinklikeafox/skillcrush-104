			<h4>Don't Give Up!</h4>
			<p>When I started the Skillcrush blueprint for Front End Web Development, I had a few years of working with HTML code under my belt, but no formal training. Admittedly, I was a complete greenhorn and no amount of independant study could have prepared me for what was in store. I'm not the best at organization - there is a huge wealth of information and tutorials available for people looking to learn how to code on their own, but I am not the kind of person who is adept at pulling it all together, or even knowing where to begin.</p>
			
			<p>Enter Skillcrush. I found Skillcrush at a time when I was reconsidering my career path due to family obligations. I've worked freelance for a few years but with my toddler getting older, our family needed a second income, and I was hoping to find one that would still allow me to do what I do best from home, where I can still take care of our growing brood.<p>
			
			<p>I won't sugar coat it. For me, this process has been hard! I had to take a break because I found myself so far behind. Learning code is literally learning a new language. There are lots of rules around syntax and structure that will turn your head. But it's important that you never give up! When I finally came back after a month's break, even my crazy mom-brain hasn't been able to hold me back. I had a renewed sense of purpose and somehow, it started to click!</p>
			
			<p>Skillcrush is flexible, and their staff are knowledgable and helpful. Once you're in, you're in! You have access to your lessons as long as you want, if you want or need to start over again with a different blueprint group, they offer to change you over twice for no cost. This has been invaluable. And though I'm still intimidated by coding and this dynamic, techie world, I know when I move forward and finally get through this course I'm going to be all the better for it. Isn't that the kind of role model we want to be for our kids? The kind that never gives up? That's what I want for me, and I want it for you too.</p>
